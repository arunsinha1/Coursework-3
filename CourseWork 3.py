Please input how you would like the code to be run using the instructions below:
"-explain" will provide a set of instructions for solving the puzzle (i.e as a list of commands such as “Put 2 in location (3, 4)”
"-file" will read a grid from a file (specified with the first argument), solves it, and then saves the solution to another file (specified as OUTPUT)
"-hint N" where N is a number, rather than giving the full solution, instead returns a grid with N values filled in.
"-profile" measures the performance of your solver(s) (in terms of time) for grids of different size (2x2, 3x2, 3x3) and difficulties (specified by number of unfilled locations). This should average the performance over a few solution attempts and starting conditions, summarising the results as a plot(s)
