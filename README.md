# Coursework-3

Hi Daniel,

The file you should run is called "CourseWork 3.py"

Please ensure that in the same folder as the python script, there is a folder named "grids".
This folder contains the following files:

easy1
easy2
easy3
med1
med2
hard1

If you would like to input different grids, just make sure they are saved in this location as a .txt file.

This folder should also contain an folder named "solutions". This is where the solutions of the inputted files are saved.

When trying the "-file INPUT OUTPUT" multiple times, please ensure you use different filenames for OUTPUT each time, or alternatively, delete the file that is written to, in the folder "solutions", between each run.

Thanks, 
Arun
